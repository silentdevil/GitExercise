SNUPDATE 02/07

DONE:
	Changed the design of Exercise2, changed HashMap to HashSet.
	Overrode the Equals and HashCode of Map Object, removed the id variable of Map Object
	Studied streams for collections

TODO:
	Prepare for checkpoint tomorrow
	Read book (Java Collections and Concurrency in Practice)
	Study Threads and Streams
	
ISSUES:
	I noticed that HashMap is unnecessary in my design because id variable of map
		does only a little use. HashSet is better to prevent duplicate Objects but be
		sure to override the equals and hashcode.
		
	My changeKey and changeValue has almost identical codes, but I'm not sure if 
	making a generic code with identifier for that is more efficient. 
		
LEARNINGS:
	Some collections can also do the functions of other collections, they can also perform their
	duties IF you don't consider efficiency. 
	Streams can also be used to iterate the collections.
